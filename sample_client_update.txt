Hi,

We've made some important decisions about our child's education. 
We've decided to send our child to Johns Hopkins University starting next year.
The tuition will be $110,000 per year for 4 years. This is a significant 
investment but we believe it's the right choice for their future.

My wife is planning to work part-time starting in 3 months to help with 
childcare costs and provide more flexibility for our family.

We're also considering buying a new house in 2 years for around $2.5 million.
This would be a major purchase but we think the timing works well with 
our current financial situation.

Additionally, I received a promotion with a 20% bonus increase. This should help
significantly with the education costs and overall financial planning.

However, we're also planning a major home renovation in 6 months 
that will cost about $150,000. This is necessary to accommodate 
our growing family needs.

We're also considering increasing our charitable giving this year 
to take advantage of the higher income.

Thanks,
Client
