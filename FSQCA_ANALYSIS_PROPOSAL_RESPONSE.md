## ðŸ”„ **Alternative Approximation Methods**

### **Alternative 1: Weighted Averaging with Confidence Scores**
```python
def _weighted_average_features(self, cluster_paths: List[SuccessPath]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Weighted averaging based on confidence scores"""
    
    weighted_sums = {}
    weight_sums = {}
    
    for path in cluster_paths:
        weight = path.confidence  # Use confidence as weight
        
        for feature_name, feature_value in path.features.items():
            if feature_name not in weighted_sums:
                weighted_sums[feature_name] = 0
                weight_sums[feature_name] = 0
            
            weighted_sums[feature_name] += feature_value * weight
            weight_sums[feature_name] += weight
    
    # Calculate weighted averages
    weighted_features = {}
    for feature_name in weighted_sums:
        if weight_sums[feature_name] > 0:
            weighted_features[feature_name] = weighted_sums[feature_name] / weight_sums[feature_name]
        else:
            weighted_features[feature_name] = 0
    
    return weighted_features
```

**Advantages**: 
- Accounts for confidence levels in averaging
- More accurate for high-confidence success paths
- Reduces impact of low-confidence outliers

### **Alternative 2: Fuzzy Clustering with Membership Degrees**
```python
def _fuzzy_cluster_features(self, success_paths: List[SuccessPath]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Fuzzy clustering approach with membership degrees"""
    
    from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
    
    # Extract feature vectors
    feature_vectors = np.array([list(path.features.values()) for path in success_paths])
    
    # Apply fuzzy K-means
    kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)
    cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(feature_vectors)
    
    # Calculate membership degrees
    membership_degrees = {}
    for i, path in enumerate(success_paths):
        cluster_id = cluster_labels[i]
        distance_to_center = np.linalg.norm(
            feature_vectors[i] - kmeans.cluster_centers_[cluster_id]
        )
        membership_degree = 1 / (1 + distance_to_center)
        
        for feature_name, feature_value in path.features.items():
            if feature_name not in membership_degrees:
                membership_degrees[feature_name] = []
            membership_degrees[feature_name].append(feature_value * membership_degree)
    
    # Calculate fuzzy averages
    fuzzy_features = {}
    for feature_name, values in membership_degrees.items():
        fuzzy_features[feature_name] = np.mean(values)
    
    return fuzzy_features
```

**Advantages**:
- Handles overlapping cluster boundaries
- More nuanced feature importance
- Better for complex financial patterns

### **Alternative 3: Ensemble Averaging with Multiple Clustering Methods**
```python
def _ensemble_average_features(self, success_paths: List[SuccessPath]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Ensemble averaging using multiple clustering methods"""
    
    clustering_methods = ['kmeans', 'dbscan', 'hierarchical']
    ensemble_results = []
    
    for method in clustering_methods:
        # Apply different clustering method
        if method == 'kmeans':
            clustering = KMeans(n_clusters=5, random_state=42)
        elif method == 'dbscan':
            clustering = DBSCAN(eps=0.3, min_samples=5)
        elif method == 'hierarchical':
            clustering = AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=5)
        
        # Extract features and cluster
        feature_vectors = np.array([list(path.features.values()) for path in success_paths])
        cluster_labels = clustering.fit_predict(feature_vectors)
        
        # Calculate averaged features for this method
        method_features = self._average_features_by_clusters(success_paths, cluster_labels)
        ensemble_results.append(method_features)
    
    # Ensemble average across all methods
    ensemble_features = {}
    feature_names = list(ensemble_results[0].keys())
    
    for feature_name in feature_names:
        values = [result[feature_name] for result in ensemble_results if feature_name in result]
        ensemble_features[feature_name] = np.mean(values)
    
    return ensemble_features
```

**Advantages**:
- Robust to clustering method choice
- Reduces bias from single clustering approach
- More stable results across different datasets

### **Alternative 4: Temporal Weighted Averaging**
```python
def _temporal_weighted_average(self, success_paths: List[SuccessPath]) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """Temporal weighted averaging based on recency"""
    
    # Sort paths by timestamp
    sorted_paths = sorted(success_paths, key=lambda p: p.timestamp)
    
    temporal_weights = []
    for i, path in enumerate(sorted_paths):
        # More recent paths get higher weights
        weight = 1 + (i / len(sorted_paths))  # Linear weight increase
        temporal_weights.append(weight)
    
    # Normalize weights
    total_weight = sum(temporal_weights)
    normalized_weights = [w / total_weight for w in temporal_weights]
    
    # Calculate temporal weighted averages
    weighted_features = {}
    feature_names = list(sorted_paths[0].features.keys())
    
    for feature_name in feature_names:
        weighted_sum = 0
        for path, weight in zip(sorted_paths, normalized_weights):
            weighted_sum += path.features.get(feature_name, 0) * weight
        weighted_features[feature_name] = weighted_sum
    
    return weighted_features
```

**Advantages**:
- Accounts for temporal evolution of success patterns
- Adapts to changing market conditions
- More relevant for dynamic financial environments
