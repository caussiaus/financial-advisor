Omega Mesh Financial System Demonstration

This script demonstrates the sophisticated stochastic financial modeling system
that implements:

1. PDF processing for milestone extraction
2. Continuous stochastic mesh with geometric Brownian motion
3. Ultra-flexible payment structures ("1% today, 11% next Tuesday, rest on grandmother's birthday")
4. Accounting constraint validation
5. Mesh evolution where past omega disappears and future visibility changes

The system models financial decisions as a continuous stochastic process where
there are infinite paths and at each moment the ball moves under geometric
Brownian motion. Investment methodologies follow different payment structures
and as they are paid off, they solidify the position of the process.
