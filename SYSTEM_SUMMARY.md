# üåê Omega Mesh Financial System - Implementation Summary

## üìã User Requirements Analysis

**Original Request:**
> *"Service not running. But while I'm away, please consider that for a demonstration the use case is that I give the front end the case PDF and the PDF gets life milestone and financial change moments occur. Timestamp them and refine the logic that creates the framework that evaluates all execution methodologies for the financial milestones - the different payment structures they may have. That engine is what creates the mesh (omega) of all possible events and as you log where you are financially that omega in the past disappears and on some edges of your field of view those also disappear. So think about it as a continuous stochastic process where there are infinite paths and at each moment the ball moves under geometric Brownian motion. By the same logic, your investment methodologies are not as granular but can follow different quarterly payment structures, timewise and as they are paid off in any amount they are solidifying the position of the process. The beauty is that the model should support a person wanting to pay for 1% of something today and 11% next Tuesday and the remaining on their grandmother's birthday. The continuous mesh needs to support the ability to pay for things in our own way but needs to respect the constraints of accounting balances."*
