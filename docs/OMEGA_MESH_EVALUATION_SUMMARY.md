- **Example:** "Save $3,720 for emergency_fund (Priority: MEDIUM)"

### Configuration Matrix Predictions

The system creates **multiple scenario pathways** showing:

#### Conservative Scenario (30% probability)
- **Asset Allocation:** 40% cash, 40% bonds, 20% stocks
- **Expected Growth:** 14.8-20.8% annualized
- **Risk Level:** Low
