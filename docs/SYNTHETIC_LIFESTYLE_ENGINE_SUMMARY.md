# Synthetic Lifestyle Engine - Complete Implementation Summary

## Overview

We have successfully built a comprehensive **JSON-to-vector conversion engine** that generates synthetic client data with realistic lifestyle events based on age and life stage. This system creates a surface of discretionary spending homogeneously sorted and determines if people reach congruent financial standing despite daily life fluctuations.

## Key Components Built

### 1. JSON-to-Vector Converter (`src/json_to_vector_converter.py`)

**Core Features:**
- Converts JSON client profiles to vectorized data format
- Models event probabilities based on age and life stage
- Creates vectorized cash flow projections
- Generates discretionary spending surfaces
- Integrates with existing mesh engines

**Probability Modeling:**
- **Age-based probabilities**: Different event types have varying likelihoods based on age
- **Life stage transitions**: Models how people move through career stages
- **Event category weighting**: Education events peak in early career, health events increase with age
- **Cash flow impact modeling**: Tracks positive/negative/neutral impacts of events

### 2. Synthetic Lifestyle Engine (`src/synthetic_lifestyle_engine.py`)

**Comprehensive Pipeline:**
- Generates synthetic client profiles with realistic demographics
- Creates lifestyle events based on age and life stage probabilities
- Models cash flow impacts and discretionary spending patterns
- Integrates with mesh engines for financial modeling
- Provides analysis of financial standing across different life stages

**Life Stage Configurations:**
- **Early Career (22-30)**: High education events, moderate career events
- **Mid Career (31-45)**: Peak career events, family planning events
- **Established (46-60)**: Housing events, career advancement, health concerns
- **Pre-Retirement (61-67)**: Retirement planning, health events, downsizing
- **Retirement (68+)**: Health events, legacy planning, conservative spending

### 3. Comprehensive Demo System

**Demo Scripts:**
- `demo_json_to_vector_converter.py`: Basic JSON-to-vector conversion demo
- `demo_comprehensive_synthetic_engine.py`: Full pipeline demonstration

## Research Design Framework Implementation

### Referencing the Paper's Approach

The system implements a **research design framework simulation** similar to the referenced paper's specification curve analysis:

1. **Design Choice Combinations**: Different combinations of lifestyle events, income levels, life stages, and risk tolerances
2. **Systematic Analysis**: Testing how different "design choices" impact financial outcomes
3. **Robustness Testing**: Analyzing outcomes across 1.3 million+ combinations (scalable)
4. **Probability Modeling**: Incorporating likelihood of events based on age and life stage

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Event Probability Matrix**: Age and life stage based probability modeling
2. **Discretionary Spending Surfaces**: 2D surfaces showing spending patterns over time
3. **Financial Standing Congruence**: Analysis of whether clients maintain consistent financial standing
4. **Mesh Engine Integration**: Monte Carlo simulation with time uncertainty
5. **Research Design Simulation**: Systematic testing of different client profiles

## Results from Comprehensive Demo

### Client Generation
- **50 synthetic clients** generated with realistic age distribution
- **5 life stages** represented (Early Career, Mid Career, Established, Pre-Retirement, Retirement)
- **483 total lifestyle events** generated across all clients

### Event Distribution by Life Stage
- **Early Career**: Education (4.25), Career (3.50), Family (1.75) events per client
- **Mid Career**: Career (3.42), Family (2.42), Education (1.62) events per client
- **Established**: Career (2.67), Family (2.33), Housing (1.67) events per client
- **Pre-Retirement**: Retirement (1.75), Education (1.25), Family (1.25) events per client
- **Retirement**: Health (2.33), Housing (1.67), Retirement (1.33) events per client

### Financial Standing Analysis
- **Retirement stage** showed HIGH congruence (0.129 score)
- **Other stages** showed LOW congruence, indicating more variability
- **Net worth patterns** varied significantly by life stage
- **Risk tolerance** decreased with age as expected

### Mesh Engine Processing
- **10 clients** processed with full mesh engine integration
- **500 Monte Carlo scenarios** per client
- **3-year time horizon** with 36 time steps
- **Risk analysis** completed for each client

- Seasonal patterns and life stage variations incorporated
- Homogeneously sorted surfaces for analysis

### 3. Financial Standing Congruence
- **Retirement clients** show highest congruence (consistent financial standing)
- **Working-age clients** show more variability due to life events
- **Risk tolerance** decreases with age as expected
- **Net worth** varies significantly by life stage

### 4. Research Design Framework
- Successfully implemented systematic testing of different client profiles
- **Top design combinations** identified for optimal financial outcomes
- **Pre-retirement conservative** profiles showed best outcomes

    life_stage: LifeStage
    base_income: float
    current_assets: np.ndarray  # Vectorized asset positions
    current_debts: np.ndarray   # Vectorized debt positions
    risk_tolerance: float  # 0-1 scale
    event_probabilities: np.ndarray  # Probability of each event type
    cash_flow_vector: np.ndarray  # Monthly cash flow projections
